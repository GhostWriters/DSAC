# Welcome to DSAC!

DSAC is your friend! DSAC is your buddy!  DSAC's ultimate goal is to give you all the proper configuration information for every selected application at install!

### What is DSAC?

DSAC is shorthand for DockSTARTer Application Configurator

### What DSAC is NOT?

DSAC will not replace DockSTARTer's configuration nor is it meant to. DSAC is an optional set of very specific configurations and tasks to make sure you have a turnkey and completely setup server!

### Why DSAC?

DSAC will help you through the tough and complex task of having a turnkey setup for your DockSTARTer.


It will assist with:
```bash
   Presenting you with a checklist of activities necessary.
   Error check you at critical steps for the information needed to continue.
   The ability to fill in the configuration information necessary.
   Pushing that info into your DockSTARTer install.
```

### What to know about DSAC?

DSAC is still under heavy development and early users expect bugs.
