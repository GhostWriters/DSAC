## Welcome to DSAC!

DockSTARTer Application Configurator or DSAC as we call it is super nice!

DSAC is your friend!  DSAC is your buddy!

...but DSAC won't pick you up at the airport.  Come on now, that's asking a bit much from a script...

DSAC will though help you through the tough and complex task of having a turnkey setup for your DockSTARTer install!  DSAC will not replace DockSTARTer's configuration nor is it meant to.
DSAC is an optional set of very specific configurations and task to make sure you have a turnkey and completely setup server!

DSAC is still under heavy development and early users expect bugs and many MANY bad jokes.  Trust me.  They are going to be real groaners of bad jokes.  Oh and the bugs may be a little annoying to...  But the jokes. Yea... sorry in advance....
